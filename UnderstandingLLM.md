# Understanding Large Language Models (LLMs) with Simple Math

## Key Concepts of LLMs:
1. **Neural Networks**: Models that process numerical inputs to produce outputs.
2. **Training**: Adjusting parameters to minimize prediction errors.
3. **Text Generation**: Predicting the next word based on context.
4. **Embeddings**: Represent words as numerical vectors for semantic meaning.
5. **Tokenization**: Breaking words into smaller units for efficient processing.
6. **Attention Mechanisms**: Help models focus on relevant input parts.
7. **Transformer Architecture**: Foundation of many LLMs, enabling efficient sequential data handling.

## Important Techniques:
- **Softmax Function**: Converts scores into probabilities.
- **Residual Connections**: Aid gradient flow in deep networks.
- **Layer Normalization**: Stabilizes and accelerates training.
- **Dropout**: Prevents overfitting by randomly omitting units during training.
- **Multi-Head Attention**: Enables focus on different input sections simultaneously.
- **Positional Embeddings**: Adds sequence position context to inputs.

## Model Example:
- **GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)**: A type of transformer model designed for generating coherent, human-like text.
